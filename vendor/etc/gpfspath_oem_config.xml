This file is configured by OEM to customize the path used by GP FS listener
service to save files, and will be located in /vendor/etc on device

"gp_data_path" and "gp_persist_path" are the /data and /persist partition
path to save files, respectively.
By default, "gp_data_path" is "/data/vendor/tzstorage/", and
"gp_persist_path" is "/persist/data/".

To replace with different paths, please also create folder in init.qcom.rc
file and update SEAndroid policy.

Take "/data/vendor/tzstorage/" as an example below,

A) rootdir/etc/init.qcom.rc:
# Create /data/vendor/tzstorage directory for SFS listener
mkdir /data/vendor/tzstorage 0770 system system

B) common/file.te:
# SFS listener data file
type data_tzstorage_file, file_type, data_file_type;

C) common/file_contexts:
/data/vendor/tzstorage(/.*)?       u:object_r:data_tzstorage_file:s0

D) common/qseecomd.te:
# Allow SFS to write to data partition
allow tee data_tzstorage_file:dir create_dir_perms;
allow tee data_tzstorage_file:file create_file_perms;

-->


<sfs_path>
    <gp_data_path> /data/vendor/tzstorage/ </gp_data_path>
    <gp_persist_path> /persist/data/ </gp_persist_path>
